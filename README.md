training flask on real project

this is just training ground for better understanding how does the python works with HTML, how to make basic functions like database connect, authorisation, configure pages through jinja templates and cycles using database and css and so on. this project will never be finished as flask is not a good choice for reaching the result that I'm trying to reach. it's just for practice and getting some confidence in web development. next step is to make a fully working commercial website for my current workplace using django, bootstrap, mysql, telegram api and whatever helps me to reach my goals.
